              (Acquirer Reference Number) or UTR (Unique Transaction Reference
              Number) to the Member for refunds made to the Member. However, in
              an event of non-receipt of such a refund in the designated Bank
              Account it will be the responsibility of the Member to provide
              VistaPrint with the set of documents required to support the claim
              of non-receipt. VistaPrint through its payment’s service provider
              shall, initiate the refund procedure post satisfactory
              verification of the documents provided by the member.

              If a member chose to avail Merchant Credit in lieu of refund, such
              credit will be available for use by the Member for a period of
              (45) forty-five days. Post such period, the merchant credit will
              lapse and hence would not be usable for any future payments by the
              Member.
